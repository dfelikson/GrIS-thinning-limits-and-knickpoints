# GrIS-thinning-limits-and-knickpoints

This repository contains scripts that create plots found in Felikson et al., 2020. The scripts use data extracted along Greenland outlet glacier flowlines that can be found here: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/doi/10.5281/zenodo.4088727.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4088727).

This repository is being updated while the manuscript is in review with the goal of being complete, with all scripts necessary to reproduce the figures in the manuscript, by the time that the manuscript is accepted for publication. The scripts that have been provided are samples for reviewers to have the ability to read and investigate the underlying data, if desired.
